# Markov-Chains-in-Python

A Markov chain is a discrete-time stochastic process that progresses from one state to another with certain probabilities. probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the current state and time elapsed, and not on the sequence of state that preceded it

### Why Markov Chains?
They are widely employed in economics, game theory, communication theory, genetics and finance. They arise broadly in statistical specially Bayesian statistics and information-theoretical contexts. When it comes real-world problems, they are used to postulate solutions to study cruise control systems in motor vehicles, queues or lines of customers arriving at an airport, exchange rates of currencies, etc. The algorithm known as PageRank, which was originally proposed for the internet search engine Google, is based on a Markov process. Reddit's Subreddit Simulator is a fully-automated subreddit that generates random submissions and comments using markov chains, so cool!

### Markov Chain
A random process or often called stochastic property is a mathematical object defined as a collection of random variables. A Markov chain has either discrete state space (set of possible values of the random variables) or discrete index set (often representing time) - given the fact, many variations for a Markov chain exists. Usually the term "Markov chain" is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is a Discrete Time Markov chain (DTMC).

### Model
The Markov Chain depicted in the state diagram has 3 possible states: sleep, run, icecream. So, the transition matrix will be 3 x 3 matrix. Notice, the arrows exiting a state always sums up to exactly 1, similarly the entries in each row in the transition matrix must add up to exactly 1 - representing probability distribution. In the transition matrix, the cells do the same job that the arrows do in the state diagram.

"Starting from the state: sleep, what is the probability that Cj will be running (state: run) at the end of a sad 2-day duration?"

Also, with this clear in mind, it becomes easier to understand some important properties of Markov chains:

  - Reducibility: a Markov chain is said to be irreducible if it is possible to get to any state from any state. In other words, a Markov chain is irreducible if there exists a chain of steps between any two states that has positive probability.
  - Periodicity: a state in a Markov chain is periodic if the chain can return to the state only at multiples of some integer larger than 1. Thus, starting in state 'i', the chain can return to 'i' only at multiples of the period 'k', and k is the largest such integer. State 'i' is aperiodic if k = 1 and periodic if k > 1.
  - Transience and Recurrence: A state 'i' is said to be transient if, given that we start in state 'i', there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to 'i'. State i is recurrent (or persistent) if it is not transient. A recurrent state is known as positive recurrent if it is expected to return within a finite number of steps and null recurrent otherwise.
  - Ergodicity: a state 'i' is said to be ergodic if it is aperiodic and positive recurrent. If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic.
  - Absorbing State: a state i is called absorbing if it is impossible to leave this state. Therefore, the state 'i' is absorbing if pii = 1 and pij = 0 for i â‰  j. If every state can reach an absorbing state, then the Markov chain is an absorbing Markov chain.
